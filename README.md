# Questsmith Agent

A no-nonsense, emotionally intelligent job search automation agent for 3-day job search sprints.  
Questsmith keeps you moving with actionable checklists, micro-projects, and tactical recaps—no hype, no coddling.

## Features

- Targeted company and role research
- Tailored outreach and follow-up
- Micro-project scoping (1–2 days, realistic)
- XP/badge tracking for progress
- Ghosting/failure handling with tactical resets
- Repeatable tasks (e.g., deep GitHub project indexing)

## Usage

1. Copy the system prompt (`questsmith_system_prompt.md`) into your favorite LLM agent or automation tool.
2. Use the repeatable tasks in `/repeatable_tasks` as modular instructions for the agent.
3. Connect your Notion, Sheets, or local JSON for tracking (if using with code).
4. Run 3-day sprints and let Questsmith handle the tactical grind.

## Extending

- Add new repeatable tasks to `/repeatable_tasks`.
- Add outreach or micro-project templates to `/templates`.
- See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for how to structure new prompts or tasks.
